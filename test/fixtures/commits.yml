    Make test logs easier to read.

    Tagging every message in tests makes the logs really wide. It's great
    for grepping, but annoying to open in an editor or a narrow terminal.
    Try out a different approach: spit out a heading before each test.

    silences "possibly useless use of :: in void context" warnings

    The AS utility silence_warnings does not really silence this
    one, because it is issued at parse-time. It seemed to in
    some places because the constant was the only expression in
    the block and therefore it was its return value, that could
    potentially be used by silence_warnings are return value of
    the yield call.

    To bypass the warning we assign to a variable. The chosen
    variable is "_" because it is special-cased in parse.c not
    to issue an "assigned but unused variable" warning in turn.
