== Rails Contributors

(THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT WORK YET, WORKING ON IT, STAY TUNNED.)

Rails has had lots of contributors. This web application keeps an up to date list of them and their contributions.

That list is not easy to build. Rails used Subversion until March 2008, and commits in Subversion do not distinguish author from committer. To give due credit to contributors some identifier was usually put in square brackets at the end of the commit message, or in the Changelog.

That was a convention followed by hand. As a consequence over the time a given contributor often appears under different names, handlers, emails, there are typos, etc.

I wanted to present a good enough figure for the number of Rails contributors in my keynote at Conferencia Rails 2008 and started an effort in the core list to identify these equivalences:

   http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/7554c8c5a25b4765

Lots and lots of people provided mappings, it was really awesome. Still today I get some new equivalence now an then. I wrote a script that took that mapping into account and converged to 1300 people, published in a gist that has been regularly maintained:

   http://gist.github.com/20721

Now that script is going to be the starting point for a wepapp dedicated to all people that have contributed to build Rails day after day.
